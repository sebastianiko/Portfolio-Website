I have successfully created the `ProjectsComponent` as a standalone Angular component and integrated it into your application.

Here is a summary of the files created and modified:

*   **Created:** `src/app/projects/projects.component.ts`
*   **Created:** `src/app/projects/projects.component.html`
*   **Created:** `src/app/projects/projects.component.scss`
*   **Modified:** `src/app/app.component.ts` (to import and use the new component)
*   **Modified:** `src/app/app.component.html` (to display the new component and adjust the layout)

The `ProjectsComponent` now displays your project data in a responsive, alternating zigzag pattern on desktop and a stacked layout on mobile, as you requested.

You can now run `ng serve` to see the results.
